# ImageC

# C++ Project made with collaboration of 3 students of the University of Porto, FEUP. The project aims to convert PNG images to a two-dimensional matrix of pixels, then the Script file takes that matrix and organizes it into 
# different functionalities.

# Object-Oriented Programming was used in this project with the implementation of 3 main classes:

# 1 - Color : with atributes Red, Green and Blue. Allows the programmer to set a pixel in a desinty of colors, manipulating each atribute between 0 - 255 values.
# 2 - Image : Creates a two-dimensional matrix of colors (pixels), given the width and height, each color correponds to a pixel of the image.
# 3 - Script : presents differents functionalites to the image, such as:
  # Open image 
  # Blank image - creates a blank image
  # Save image
  # Invert image 
  # Convert image to gray scale
  # Replace a pixel of the image
  # Fill image
  # Mirror image (horizontally of vertically)
  # Add two images together
  # Crop image
  # Rotate image (left or right)
  # Apply median filter
